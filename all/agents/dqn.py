class DQN(Agent):
    '''
    Deep Q-Network (DQN).
    DQN was one of the original deep reinforcement learning algorithms.
    It extends the ideas behind Q-learning to work well with modern convolution networks.
    The core innovation is the use of a replay buffer, which allows the use of batch-style
    updates with decorrelated samples. It also uses a "target" network in order to
    improve the stability of updates.

    Args:
        q (QNetwork): An Approximation of the Q function.
        policy (GreedyPolicy): A policy derived from the Q-function.
        replay_buffer (ReplayBuffer): The experience replay buffer.
        discount_factor (float): Discount factor for future rewards.
        exploration (float): The probability of choosing a random action.
        loss (function): The weighted loss function to use.
        minibatch_size (int): The number of experiences to sample in each training update.
        n_actions (int): The number of available actions.
        replay_start_size (int): Number of experiences in replay buffer when training begins.
        update_frequency (int): Number of timesteps per training update.
