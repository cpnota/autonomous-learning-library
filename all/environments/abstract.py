    A reinforcement learning Environment.

    In reinforcement learning, an Agent learns by interacting with an Environment.
    An Environment defines the dynamics of a particular problem:
    the states, the actions, the transitions between states, and the rewards given to the agent.
    Environments are often used to benchmark reinforcement learning agents,
    or to define real problems that the user hopes to solve using reinforcement learning.
